								<p>A flooded Pershing Square for the second Women’s March on Saturday, holding posters calling for women’s rights, disparaging the policies of President Donald Trump and encouraging participants to vote for the Nov. 6 midterm election. <br><br>
									While there was a handful of Trump supporters staging an anti-protest, holding signs that read “Make America Great Again” and “Beautiful Women Love Trump,” Women’s March volunteers formed a chain around the anti-protesters and dozens of LAPD members stood guard. The March remained a peaceful demonstration and police reported no arrests or major incidents.

								<p>While last year’s inaugural march — which drew an estimated 750,000 people — centered on the theme “Hear Our Voice,” this year, the focus shifted to “Hear Our Vote.” Thousands of attendees publicized the hashtag #powertothepolls over social media.
The demonstrators gathered in Pershing Square for a short rally. At 10 a.m., they marched in solidarity to Grand Park and Los Angeles City Hall. At City Hall, a number of celebrities gave speeches to the crowds, including Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman, Eva Longoria, Olivia Wilde and Viola Davis, who each urged the crowds to keep the momentum of the march going by voting at the midterm elections.

									<p>Many of the demonstrators found Davis’ speech to be the most impactful. As a sexual assault survivor herself, Davis spoke out about the strength of those who have endured the same experiences she did, encouraging them to use that strength to enact change through voting. 
"I am always introduced as an award-winning actor, but my testimony is one of poverty,” Davis said in her speech. “My testimony is one of being sexually assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me, and I know that every single day when I think of that, I know that the trauma of those events are still with me today. And that's what drives me to the voting booth.”
</p>

									<p>Davis also spoke about the victims of sex trafficking and the fact that women of color are disproportionately affected by it. According to Davis, 70 percent of victims of sex trafficking are girls of color. She spoke about standing up for the women who could not come forward. 
“I am speaking today, not just for the #MeToo’s, because I was a #MeToo, but when I raise my hand, I am aware of all the women who are still in silence,” Davis said. “The women who are faceless, the women who don’t have the money … and who don’t have the images in our media that gives them a sense of self-worth enough to break their silence that’s rooted in the shame of assault.”
